          Running this build involves trying to get your Ward of Dawn super as often as possible. You want to have a bubble for your teammates as often as possible. The bubble can be used to capture points
          or defend your team from a large boss attack, as well as give your team a 35% boost in damage. The Helm also provides an overshield when entering the bubble. If using the bubble to capture points, cast the bubble only when you are getting
          shot at to get the most out of its duration. Also, keep a weapon with the Vorpal Weapon mod on to be able to defeat guardians with their super active quickly so they don't kill you within the bubble. For guardians without their super active
          entering your bubble, you're pretty much invincible while inside the bubble so 1-2 punches usually does the trick. Ive found that it takes two pucnhes to kill without your defensive strike ability active, and only one while it is active.
          Saving the melee ability for when you pop your super could be helpful as getting off the two punches on the first poor sap to enter your bubble will activate defensive strike, which should last you the majority of the bubble's duration.
          With defensive strike active, guardians are a one hit punch while within the bubble.</p>

        <p class="description">
          An important tip I have learned while running this build is <strong>STAY IN THE BUBBLE.</strong> You may feel invincible and think the overshield will protect if you want to run out and kill a guardian really quick, however avoid this
          temptation. The point of the bubble is to help your TEAMMATES, and lock down the point. Wait for your team to get to you; they will enter your bubble for the buffs and kill the enemy guardians for you. Your job is to stay inside the bubble
          and keep it going for as long as possible. Remember that if you die, the bubble dies with you, removing the ability for your teammates to get buffs, hence why it is important to have a vorpal weapon mod to be able to defend yourself from
          enemy supers while alone inside the bubble.</p>

        <p class="description">
          The recent update to the Ward of Dawn makes it dependent on resilience for it to withstand boss damage, so when running this build in PvE its vital to get that resilience stat to 100 to get the best defense against boss damage; or perhaps
          run the Boss Negater when in PvE instead. To get your bubble a little faster, equip the Doom Fang Pauldron while charging your super to get bonus charge on melee kills, then switch to the Helm of Saint-14 just before popping your super to
          get the overshield, as well as blinding enemies who walk into your bubble. You could also mod the Pauldron to boost your strength and/or intellect, then mod the Helm with resilience to get the most out of it.</p>

        <p class="description">
          If you are running the Doom Fang Pauldrons while you don't have super, mods that give super energy on melee kills can be helpful. If not, your high resilience gives you your class ability pretty often, so mods that give super energy on
          class ability use are helpful. </p>

            <p class="description">
              Similar to the bubble titan, this build involves getting sentinel shield as often as possible. The Doom Fang Pauldrons allow you to gain your super more quickly with melee kills, and while in your super, getting kills with your shield
              throw makes your super last longer. While in your super the bottom tree void will give you two shield throws, and with the exotic, getting melee kills (left-click) with the shield will charge your shield throw ability, allowing you to
              extend your super further. </p>
            <p class="description">
              To keep your super running for as long as possible, spam your shield throws at any enemy you see to keep your super up longer. Only block when you need to as that will waste energy. You aren't reliant upon your team nor are you trying
              to generate orbs for your team. Focus on yourself. When waiting for a shield throw charge, get those melee kills to charge it faster. Once the shield throw is charged, get it off at the first enemy you see, don't try to wait for a group
              of enemies as your super could be gone by then. When playing against more skilled opponents, they tend to stick in groups of 2-3 anyways as they are in a discord together with team synergy, so you might get lucky and hit two even if you
              only threw at one. </p>

            <p class="description">
              Using mods that give super energy on melee kills can also be pretty helpful as you are running a lot of strength. This could help you get your super even faster.

                  This build is almost entirely for PvE. Having a team in discord you can communicate your super with can help make this build even more effective. The idea is to use the super mainly on bosses or minibosses with lots of champions in
                  the area. While in your super, blocking has a really large radius and extends your super life AND generates orbs of light. When your team shoots through the shield, they gain a 25% damage buff. In theory, technically you sacrifice
                  your DPS to assist your teammates, however, there are a lot of factors to consider. Popping the super just before a large boss projectile attack can save your teammates, keeping them alive longer to do more DPS, AND generates orbs,
                  AND makes the super last longer, AND with the exotic the blocked damage converts to super energy.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                  The exotic is important as it allows you to chain supers. Getting the super energy from incoming damage, and waiting to pick up orbs until after your super is finished should allow you to keep the supers coming, allowing you to
                  effectively negate all incoming damage from a boss and get you and your fireteam multiple supers during the course of the fight. Just block and have your fireteam shoot through. Thats your job. Maintaining enough distance from the
                  boss is important as well so you don't get stomped or split up. You want the boss focused on you so you can get the super energy while blocking, so stay together so the projectiles hit your shield.
                </p>

                <p class="description">
                  This build is one of the most fun as you get to focus on the best part of destiny: your friends. You and your friends get to communicate and fight together with you leading the charge defending everyone and providing bonus damage
                  and orbs. You really feel like true titan defending your teammates with a massive shield.
                </p>
