        <p class="description">
          In general, this build makes you the king of abilities. The exotic empowers your other abilities, allowing them to do more damage and charge faster. The high resilience allows you to just cast your shield whenever you are in trouble to
          charge your grenade or melee and empower them. The middle tree solar gives you a throwing hammer that you can get back so you can keep your empower going for grenades or barricade as well. Its just a positive feedback loop of all
          of your abilities. The roaring flames ability middle tree gives you on top of empowered melee just makes you a one hit god with your hammer. If you are really into grenades, you can focus your attention on using your melee and barricade to
          keep your grenade ability empowered, however, a build focused on the Armamentarium might be more your style. I find the throwing hammer melee to be more fun and reliable especially with this exotic, not to mention picking your hammer back
          up
          heals you so you can focus a lot less on recovery stats. </p>

        <p class="description">
          An important side note is that this exotic makes a lot more sense to use over the Hallowfire Heart as it's honestly more fun and more useful more often. The Hallowfire only really shines when your super is active, however that only happens
          two or three times a match or strike and isn't as fun. The Heart of Inmost Light is constantly buffing you and keeping you going the whole time.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Mods that provide class or melee ability energy or regeneration are the most helpful on this build. Your super isn't as important as keeping those abilities coming. </p>

              This class is pretty basic and honestly is for someone who likes to focus on weapons more than their abilities. Make sure whatever energy and power weapons you run are solar to make use of the exoctic. A solar shotgun with three stacks
              of the Firewalker perk is scary. The bigger point is that you are an enemy to all things stasis which lets be honest, stasis is cringe. You are harder to be slowed or frozen, which can be a real shock to a cringe stasis using hunter who
              roleplays as an outcast from the tower and only uses hand cannons and is perfectly optimized to deal with any situation presented to deal the most DPS at any range, yada yada yada. Those kinds of people make me angry. If thats you then
              consider this a wake up call: you're playing the game wrong and aren't having fun. This exotic makes you the perfect anti-stasis titan, showing those stupid optimized stasis hunters how much fun you can have if you don't no life the
              game.
